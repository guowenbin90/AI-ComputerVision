## Introduction to Computer Vision
### Images as Numerical Data.ipynb
- **Images as Numerical Data**  
Every pixel in an image is just a numerical value and, we can also change these pixel values. 
We can multiply every single one by a scalar to change how bright the image is, we can shift each pixel value to the right, and many more operations!
- **Treating images as grids of numbers is the basis for many image processing techniques.**  
Most color and shape transformations are done just by mathematically operating on an image and changing it pixel-by-pixel.
